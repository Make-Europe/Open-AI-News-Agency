**Lions Coach Slams Officiating After Controversial Loss: 'We Don't Know the Rules'**

**GREEN BAY, Wis.** – Detroit Lions Head Coach Dan Campbell sharply criticized NFL officiating Sunday night following a narrow 24-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. The coach’s frustration stemmed from a controversial tripping penalty called against his team in the final minutes, which nullified a key offensive gain and effectively ended their chance for a game-winning field goal.

The penalty occurred with just over one minute remaining in the fourth quarter, as the Lions were driving in Packers territory. The flag erased a crucial first down, pushing Detroit back 15 yards and ultimately forcing a turnover on downs.

In a heated post-game press conference, Campbell questioned the consistency and clarity of how such rules are enforced. "I don't know what to tell the team, because we don’t know the rules," Campbell stated when asked about the decisive call. He expressed a belief that similar actions go unpenalized in other games, leading to confusion for players and coaches alike as to what constitutes a foul. The loss drops the Lions to 1-2 on the season.

**Central Bank Hikes Interest Rates to Combat Persistent Inflation**

**WASHINGTON** – The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday, continuing its aggressive campaign to curb stubbornly high inflation. The move, announced following a two-day policy meeting, marks the eleventh rate hike since March of last year.

The decision by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) brings the key federal funds rate to a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%, its highest level in 22 years. The unanimous vote was driven by economic data showing that while inflation has cooled from its peak, it remains well above the central bank's 2% target.

In a statement, officials cited "elevated" inflation and a surprisingly resilient job market as key factors. The hike aims to slow the economy by increasing the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses, thereby dampening demand and stabilizing prices. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that future policy decisions would remain "data-dependent" as the committee assesses the cumulative impact of its actions.

**Ontex Introduces Bio-Based Absorbent to Reduce Diaper Carbon Footprint**

**AALST, Belgium** – Ontex Group NV, an international producer of personal care products, announced Wednesday that it is introducing a lower-carbon, bio-based superabsorbent polymer (bioSAP) into its diapers. The new material will initially be rolled out in the company's Moltex Pure and Nature brand, available across Europe.

The move is part of Ontex’s strategy to reduce its environmental impact. The company is gradually replacing traditional fossil-fuel-based superabsorbent polymers (SAP), a key component in a diaper's absorbent core and a significant source of its carbon emissions. According to Ontex, the new bioSAP has a carbon footprint that is 15% to 25% lower than its conventional counterpart.

The company stated the change aligns with its validated target to reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, which are largely driven by raw materials, by 25% by 2030. While the initial launch is limited, Ontex plans to expand the use of bioSAP to other products and for its retail partners in the future.

The announcement was made on July 9, 2025, from Ontex's headquarters in Aalst. The company said that while current SAP is not recyclable, it views the development of biodegradable materials as a key step toward future circular solutions for hygiene products.

### US Tariffs to Drag Down Global Economy and Insurance Growth, Swiss Re Warns

**ZURICH** – New US tariff policies are set to slow global economic growth and significantly curb the expansion of the insurance industry in 2025, according to a report released Wednesday by the Swiss Re Institute.

In its latest *sigma* study, the Zurich-based research arm of the global reinsurance giant forecasts that global GDP growth will decelerate to 2.3% in 2025, a drop from 2.8% in 2024. The institute attributes the slowdown to reduced trade and heightened economic uncertainty stemming from US policy, which it says will prompt consumers and businesses to cut spending and investment.

The report, published on July 9, 2025, predicts that the global insurance industry will follow this downward trend. Total premium growth is expected to fall sharply to 2% in 2025 from a strong 5.2% in 2024.

"US tariff policy is another move towards more market fragmentation, which would reduce the affordability and availability of insurance, and so diminish global risk resilience," said Jérôme Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist.

The analysis projects a "stagflationary shock" for the United States, with its GDP growth forecast to slow to 1.5% in 2025. The US motor insurance sector is expected to be the most directly impacted, as tariffs drive up the cost of auto parts for repairs and vehicle replacements.
